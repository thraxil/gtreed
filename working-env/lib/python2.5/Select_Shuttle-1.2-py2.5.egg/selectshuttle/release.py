# Release information about Select-Shuttle

version = "1.2"

description = """\
The SelectShuttle widget provides a mechanism for selecting \
multiple values from a list of values by allowing the user to move items \
between two lists. On modern browsers you can also double click an item to \
move it from one list to the other. After the first "move", all entries \
will be sorted automatically accordingly to its "description" on both \
lists. Take a look at the code for SelectShuttleDesc for an example of how \
to use this widget in your code."""
