Version 0.94

* Incompatible changes

  - IDs were changed from "name_id" to "name", so that both name and id are 
    the same.  This makes this more comformant to W3C standards.

* Changes

  - JavaScript templates now use the attribute "type" instead of "language"
    to signal that they are about JavaScript code.  This also makes this 
    widget more comformant to W3C standards.
